# PCA Statistical Arbitrage

1. PCA Statistical Arbitrage in the Cryptocurrency Markets: The basic idea is to decompose asset returns into systematic (market) and idiosyncratic (residual) components. We then model the residuals as a mean‑reverting (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, OU) process. When a residual deviates significantly from its equilibrium, we assume it will revert—creating a trading signal. In a market‑neutral setup, we “defactor” the returns so that our positions are hedged against broad market moves.

2. A more traditional stat arb technique constructing a mean-reverting portfolio with 3-4 assets, testing for stationarity using ADF and quantitatively investigating the time-series properties of the spread with the ARMA model
